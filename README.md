# NLQ-to-CODE
Engineered a sophisticated natural language processing system using Code-Llama to transform user queries into SQL statements.
Integrated Chroma DB for optimized CSV data retrieval and utilized LangChain to streamline the workflow.
Key Components:

    Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Code-Llama:
        Implement Code-Llama, a sophisticated language model, to understand and process natural language queries.
        Train the model to accurately interpret various query intents and convert them into corresponding SQL statements.

    Vector Database with Chroma DB:
        Use Chroma DB to store and manage vector representations of the CSV data.
        Ensure efficient retrieval of relevant data points by leveraging Chroma DB's indexing and search capabilities.

    Integration with LangChain:
        Utilize LangChain for building a robust pipeline that connects Code-Llama and Chroma DB.
        Develop a seamless flow from natural language input to SQL query generation and data retrieval.

Workflow:

    User Query Input:
        Users input their data queries in natural language through a web or desktop interface.
    Natural Language Understanding:
        The input query is processed by Code-Llama to extract the intent and required data parameters.
    SQL Query Generation:
        Based on the extracted information, the system generates an appropriate SQL query.
    Data Retrieval from CSV:
        The SQL query is executed against the CSV data stored in Chroma DB.
    Result Presentation:
        A code to get the data is presented in a structured format as Result.


  

By combining the strengths of Code-Llama, Chroma DB, and LangChain, this project provides a cutting-edge solution for intuitive and efficient data querying from CSV files.
